# Convex-Hull
This project contains two algorithms to find convex hull of given set of points.
The first is Kirkpatrick Siedel Algorithm. Refer-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkpatrick%E2%80%93Seidel_algorithm
The second is Jarvis March. Refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm
We then visualised each algorithm on a webpage.
